#### Plotly vs seaborn

Plotly is built on top of d3.js. Plotly figures are interactive and can be shared and deployed on the web. 

Seaborn is built on top of matplotlib. Therefore, users may use matplotlib functions to customize charts if a particular feature is not supported by Seaborn.
Seaborn draws charts locally and there is no web service or online chart sharing. Therefore, Seaborn is a very good tool if you just need pictures of charts.

Moreover, Plotly Express is a simplified version of Plotly which hides a lot of details of coding. Using Plotly Express, you can draw a chart with one function call, like seaborn to matplotlib.
